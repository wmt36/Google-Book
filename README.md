# Google-Book 
 
## OverView
In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## To start
If you decide to close the repo it is set up using Concurentlyso inside of you terminal run "npm run start" and the app will deploy to your localhost!

## Cod Breakdown
Like the beauty of coding faced some set back but overcam the majority of them. You are currently able to scroll through the Google Books data base which is used to show the books from the API call, and when one clicks save it saves the book to the mongo database for the user to view later. View button also works as a link to the actual book as well so if clicked it will take you directly to the link. 

## challenegs
As of now my input search bar in non functional so you cant search the data of 2000 books but you can see a result of 15 at a time.
